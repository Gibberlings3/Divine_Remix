<h1>The Divine Remix: Cleric Kits with the Sphere System Installed</h1>
<div class="section">
<p>With the sphere system installed, cleric kits change to the following:</p>
  <h4 class="subheader">Morninglord of Lathander  </h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>MORNINGLORD OF LATHANDER: Lathander, also called the Morninglord, is the
      god of the spring, dawn, birth, and renewal, a god of beginning and hidden
      potential, a deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-perfection.
      He is the commander of creativity. He is a native of the plane of Elysium,
      and he is on good terms with Chauntea. Lathander's symbol is a simple disk
      of rosy pink hue. These disks are often cut of rose quartz or similar minerals.</p>
    <p>Lathander is a god of beginnings, and even individuals who worship other
      gods still offer a prayer to him at the start of a journey of endeavor.
      Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and start new ventures or
      companies. As a result, Lathander is very popular among the merchant classes,
      and has benefited accordingly.</p>

  <h4>Watcher of Helm</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>WATCHER OF HELM: The god of guardians and protectors, Helm is the epitome
      of the guardian, the watcher, the guard, and has in years past been greatly
      venerated by those who need to remain watchful for evil at their doorsteps.
      Helm is ever-vigilant, and embodies the spirit of lawful neutrality. Helm
      makes his home on the clockwork plane of Nirvana, in a region separate
      from Mystra. Helm's Symbol is an open eye painted onto a gauntlet.</p>
    <p>Helm teaches that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared
      for one's enemies. He also serves those who stand, wait and watch carefully.
      Careful planning will always defeat rushed actions in the end.</p>
    <p>Watchers of Helm can only be of Lawful Neutral, Lawful Good, True Neutral,

  </div>
  <h4>Stormlord of Talos</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>STORMLORD OF TALOS: Talos is the destructive force of nature. He is the
      god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction.
      He makes his home in the aptly named plane of Pandemonium. He attracts
      the destroyer, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers.
      Talos' symbol is three lightning bolts, each a separate color, radiating
      from a central point.</p>
    <p>Talos the Destroyer is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive
      force that lays waiting to strike at any time. Talos is more feared than
      worshipped, which seems to account for his great popularity as much as
      anything. The church of Talos exults in the wild destruction of nature
      at its fiercest, trusting to its own luck and the favor (or ill-favor)
      of the god to protect it. Church members tend to be fatalistic in nature
      as a result--almost self-destructive. However, clerics of Talos wish to
      take as many others with them as possible.</p>
    <p>Stormlords of Talos can only be of Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, and
      Neutral Evil alignments.</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Half-Spear - 'Fury of Talos' once per day<br />
      The Half-Spear is the spiritual weapon of Stormlords of Talos, and is wielded
      as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Half-Spear is a regular
      weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at
      21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual weapon lasts for one
      round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds and can be used once per
      day.<br />
      - Innate electrical resistance of 1% per level<br />
      - Destructive Blow once per day<br />
      Once per day, a Stormlord can focus the destructive wrath of Talos in combat.
      This spell grants the Stormlord +2 to damage and +2 to hit for one round
      per level, up to 20 rounds.<br />
      - From level 7 can cast Storm Shield once per day<br />
      This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It protects the caster

      thought, travelers, wards</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Silverstar of Sel&ucirc;ne</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> SILVERSTAR OF SEL&Ucirc;NE: Sel&ucirc;ne (pronounced: seh-loon-ay), Our
      Lady of Silver, is the goddess of the moon, the stars, and those who use
      them to navigate. Her eternal foe is the evil Shar, goddess of darkness,
      night, loss, and forgetfulness. Sel&ucirc;ne is often called the Moonmaiden
      for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faer&ucirc;n. She is
      the goddess of the moon and travelers. Sel&ucirc;ne's home plane is The
      Gates of the Moon with her home a shining hall of silver called Argentil.</p>
    <p>Non-evil lycanthropes honor Sel&ucirc;ne as the master of their fate as
      do astrologers and fortune tellers. Sel&ucirc;ne is also growing popular
      among alewives, laundresses, seamstresses and servants with the message
      of female empowerment. She is also worshiped by female spellcasters, navigators
      and sailors.</p>
    <p>Sel&ucirc;ne's clerics, called Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne, are dedicated
      advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth and
      absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and
      non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere.
      They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle
      in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or
      enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena
      and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing
      its fierce, pure white light to Toril to advance the goddess's wishes.</p>
    <p>Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne can only be of Chaotic Good, Neutral Good,
      and Chaotic Neutral alignments</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Mace - 'Moon's Hand' once per day<br />
      The Moon's Hand is the spiritual weapon of Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne,
      and is wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Moon's
      Mace is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15,
      +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual
      weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />
      - Infravision<br />
      - Can cast Moon Shield once per day<br />
      Upon casting this spell, the Silverstar receives a resistance to all magic.
      The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the cleric up to a maximum
      of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set so if the target already has
      more magic resistance than the cleric would confer, it will actually lower
      it to the set value. This effect will last for the duration of the spell
      or until dispelled.<br />
      - From level 7 can cast Free Action once per day, as fourth level cleric
      spell of the same name<br />

      time, war</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Nightcloak of Shar</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>NIGHTCLOAK OF SHAR: Shar is the goddess of darkness, night, loss, and
      forgetfulness. Her main aspect is worshipped by those who deal in the night
      (such as thieves), who hate the light (such as goblin races and their allies),
      and who feel bitterness and loss. Her symbol is a black disk with a border
      of deep purple.</p>
    <p>Shar's mortal enemy is the goddess Sel&ucirc;ne and the two fight on a
      number of levels throughout their immortal lives. There is a continual
      war between the two faiths and jihads against Sel&ucirc;ne and her followers
      are common where Shar is strong.</p>
    <p>Clerics of Shar are called Nightcloaks. They exist outside the standard
      church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering
      of cells and secretive places throughout the Realms. The Nightcloaks of
      Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.</p>

  </div>
    <h4>Holy Strategist of the Red Knight</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>HOLY STRATEGIST OF THE RED KNIGHT: Holy Strategist is the name by which a
      cleric of the Red Knight is known, and it is an apt title indeed. By
      devoting themselves to mastering military tactics and strategy, these
      militant clerics hone their minds and bodies into the deadliest weapons
      in Faerun. So impressive is their reputation that armies outnumbering
      their foes three to one have been known to surrender upon learning that
      a Holy Strategist leads the opposing force.</p>
    <p>Collectively, the clerics of the Red Knight are referred to as the Red
      Fellowship. Many members serve as high-ranking commanders in armies
      throughout Faerun, often personally leading elite "special forces" units.
      Others who are not directly in the employ of the church serve as
      instructors at military academies or as quartermasters in charge of keeping
      the troops on the front line fed and supplied. When they are not in battle,
      Holy Strategists wear flowing robes of red accented with white.</p>
    <p>Holy Strategists of the Red Knight can only be of Lawful Good, Lawful
      Neutral, and Lawful Evil alignments.</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Longsword - 'Checkmate' once per day<br />

  </div>
  <h4>Battleguard of Tempus</h4>
  <p>Whether the original Beamdog kit, or the one from The Divine Remix, the kit gets updated to:</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS: Tempus is the Realms' god of war, the Lord of Battle,
      the Foehammer. He is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors
      all sides equally. He may be on an army's side on one day and against them
      the next. Such is the nature of war as embodied by Tempus.</p>
    <p>The dress of the priest of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered.
      In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but
      the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the
      trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Priests of Tempus may be
      found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know who the
      war god will favor.</p>
    <p>Battleguards of Tempus can only be of Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Good, True
      Neutral, and Chaotic Evil alignments</p>

      weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />

  </div>
  <h4>Painbearer of Ilmater</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>PAINBEARER OF ILMATER: Ilmater is the Crying God, the god of endurance,
      suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance. It is he who offers succor and
      calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He
      is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft
      the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed
      and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's symbol was a blood stained
      rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a blood red cord is used.
      The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large.
      Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises.</p>
    <p>The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers,
      but in reality they offer a great deal along the &quot;pure clerical&quot; nature
      of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead
      of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life
      over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are
      needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering
      to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray,
      with gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).</p>
    <p>Painbearers of Ilmater can only be of Lawful Good, Neutral Good, and Lawful
      Neutral alignments.</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Fist - 'Hand of Ilmater' once per day<br />
      The Hand of Ilmater is the spiritual weapon of Painbearers. The Hand of
      Ilmater does 1d6 base damage and is treated as if the caster is a grand
      master. The Hand of Ilmater is treated as a regular weapon at levels 1-5,
      +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels
      25 and above. The Hand of Ilmater lasts for one round per level of the
      caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />
      - Can Lay On Hands once per day<br />
      - From level 7 can cast Neutralize Poison once per day, as fourth level
      cleric spell of the same name<br />
      - From level 9 can cast Ilmater's Endurance once per day<br />
      The Painbearer draws upon Ilmater to be able to shoulder the burden of
      trials ahead. For 1 round per level of the Painbearer, the cleric gains
      +2 to saves, doubles <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>, is immune
      to panic and disease, and will stand firm in the face of any charge or

      of the same name<br />

  </div>
  <h4>Firewalker of Kossuth</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FIREWALKER OF KOSSUTH: Kossuth, Firelord, the Tyrant among Fire, is an
      Elemental Lord from the Elemental Plane of Fire. He is generally uncaring
      to his faithful, but continues to grant his priests their powers since
      their worship increases his power on his home plane. To maintain continued
      worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems,
      and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never
      an avatar.</p>
    <p>Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its
      structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming
      up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol
      varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of
      fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become
      unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something
      the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords,
      the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful
      in Thay and the lands of the East.</p>
    <p>Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of any alignment, but most are evil, reveling
      in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They
      dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation
      of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and
      oranges.</p>

  <h4>Authlim of Iyachtu Xvim </h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>AUTHLIM OF IYACHTU XVIM: Iyachtu Xvim is said to the result of a union
      between the Black Lord, Bane, and a greater or a true tanar'ri, and thus
      the blood of Bane runs through his veins. Another tale says he is the spawn
      of the Black Lord and a corrupted Paladin. Also called the Godson and the
      Son of Bane, Xvim has served as Bane's instrument in the Realms, carrying
      out the will of his father. He appears either as a gaunt, naked man with
      a great scimitar or a black cloud with glowing green eyes.</p>
    <p>Xvim was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep during the Time of Troubles, where
      he was held for ten years. He managed to free himself when Zhentil Keep
      fell during the Cyrinishad fiasco, where he also managed to steal the portfolios
      of Tyranny and Hatred away from Cyric. He is now the god of Fear, Hatred,
      Malice, and Tyranny. He is working toward fully taking the place of his
      father, Bane, which makes him a bitter enemy of Cyric. His following is
      strongest in the East, particularly in Thay, but his priesthood is rapidly
      spreading throughout the Realms. His priests favor black robes trimmed
      with dark green. They also wear black iron gauntlets with glowing green
      eyes painted on the back of the hand. These gauntlets are actually the
      priests' holy symbols of Xvim.</p>
    <p>Authlims of Xvim can be members of any race. They can only be of Lawful
      Evil, Lawful Neutral or Neutral Evil alignment.</p>

  <h4>Lorekeeper of Oghma</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>LOREKEEPER OF OGHMA: Oghma is the god of knowledge and invention, the
      Binder of What is Known, and the Patron of Bards. He is the most powerful
      god of knowledge in the Realms (second if you consider magical ability
      as knowledge, with Mystra at its head). Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors
      for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma
      favors.</p>
    <p>Oghma's followers believe that knowledge is most supreme, particularly
      in its raw form, the idea. An idea has no weight but can move mountains.
      It has no height but it can dominate a nation. It has no mass but it can
      push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of humankind, outweighing
      anything made by mortal hands. Before anything can exist, the idea must
      exist.</p>

  <h4>Heartwarder of Sune</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>HEARTWARDER OF SUNE: Sune (pronounced: sue-nee) Firehair is said to be
      the fairest of all the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as
      the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair
      and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan
      areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as
      well as people falling in love or looking for lifemates, often venerate
      the Lady Firehair.</p>
    <p>Sune herself is said to be benevolent and sometimes whimsical, alternating
      between deep passions and shallow flirtations. She has been romantically
      linked with many of the Faer&ucirc;nian powers in the myths of the Realms,
      though she has never shown any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona,
      or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful
      things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been
      rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time
      of Troubles.</p>
    <p>Sune's specialty priests, known as Heartwarders of Sune, are aesthetes
      and hedonists who actively seek out pleasure and beauty in all things,
      and who nurture the creation of beautiful objects. They are typically found
      in large cities in the company of the cultural elite. Most are active patrons
      of the arts, and all play the role of matchmaker for persons in all levels
      of society. Many are employed as artists, crafters, performers, or instructors,
      though a few travel the world to promote beauty and love.</p>
    <p>Heartwarders of Sune can only be of Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, and Chaotic

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FEYWARDEN OF CORELLON: The leader of the elven pantheon, Corellon Larethian
      (CORE-ehlon Lah-RETH-ee-yen) is said to have given birth to the entire
      elven race, although sometimes Sehanine or Angharradh are given credit
      as well. Elven lore states that the Fair Folk sprang from drops of blood
      Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or
      Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals
      of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including
      art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair
      Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun,
      and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf
      mages, musicians, and poets.</p>
    <p>Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made
      of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets
      engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol
      of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain
      hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor
      traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.</p>
    <p>Feywardens of Corellon must be elves or half-elves, and may be of chaotic

  <h4>Strifeleader of Cyric</h4>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>STRIFELEADER OF CYRIC: Cyric (seer-ick) is a megalomaniacal deity with
        an immense following. One of the three greater powers of evil on Faer&ucirc;n,
        he is petty and self-centered, and enjoys misleading individuals of all
        inclinations so that they perform acts that ruin their lives or so that
        they make fatal mistakes. He drinks the tears of disillusioned dreamers
        and broken-hearted lovers. He is not above an alliance with another deity
        as long as he thinks he can betray the other divine power and come out
        ahead.</p>
      <p>Cyric's church is pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere
        in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supports cruel
        rulers and indulges in intrigue in such a way that the world won't be
        overrun by wars (and thus fall under the sway of Tempus). His church
        is often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing, but this conflict
        has decreased in recent years as Cyric has gained better control of himself
        and has consolidated the churches of the deities whose portfolios he
        took over.</p>
      <p>Strifeleaders wear black and purple robes. Silver bands, the symbol
        of their enslavement to Cyric, are worn on their wrists. Strifeleaders
        of Cyric may be of Chaotic Neutral or any Evil alignment.</p>

        weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />
        - May coat his weapon in poison once per day per 6 levels. Attacks made

        6 seconds). A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total.<br />
