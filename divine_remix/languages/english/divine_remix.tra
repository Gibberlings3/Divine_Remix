Upon casting a conjure air elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Air, and an air elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster.  It is 60% likely that a 12 hit dice elemental appears, 35% likely that a 16 hit dice elemental appears, and 5% likely that a 24 hit dice elemental appears.  Once the elemental appears the caster must concentrate on the creature for 3 rounds in order to assure that the elemental will not turn on him (there is a 15% chance of losing control).  However, after this period has passed the elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done so telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature.~

The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently.  These levels can only be restored by a priest's restoration spell.~

@10301 =~Silverstar of Selûne~
// this is the sphere-enabled kit description. Spheres will be added automatically via patching
@10302 =~SILVERSTAR OF SELÛNE: Selûne (pronounced: seh-loon-ay), Our Lady of Silver, is the goddess of the moon, the stars, and those who use them to navigate. Her eternal foe is the evil Shar, goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness. Selûne is often called the Moonmaiden for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faerun. She is the goddess of the moon and travelers. Selûne's home plane is The Gates of the Moon with her home a shining hall of silver called Argentil.

Non-evil lycanthropes honor Selûne as the master of their fate as do astrologers and fortune tellers. Selûne is also growing popular among alewives, laundresses, seamstresses and servants with the message of female empowerment. She is also worshiped by female spellcasters, navigators and sailors.

Selûne's clerics, called Silverstars of Selûne, are dedicated advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth and absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere. They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing its fierce, pure white light to Toril to advance the goddess's wishes.

Abilities:
- Spiritual Weapon: Mace - 'Moon's Hand' once per day
The Moon's Hand is the spiritual weapon of Silverstars of Selûne, and is wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Moon's Mace is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.
- Infravision
- Can cast Moon Shield once per day
MOON SHIELD: Upon casting this spell, the Silverstar receives a resistance to all magic. The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the cleric up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set so if the target already has more magic resistance than the cleric would confer, it will actually lower it to the set value. This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
- From level 7 can cast Free Action once per day, as fourth level cleric spell of the same name
- From level 9 can cast Sunfire once per day, as fifth level mage spell of the same name

// iwdee bio
@10322 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Selûne, you were summoned before the Silverbrow of your order. In warm words fitting for a follower of Our Lady of Silver, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring the guidance of the Moonmaiden to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and light to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple’s casual worshipers in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the wisdom of the Moonmaiden in your heart.~
@10323 =~Selûne has long been a friend to the Morninglords.  I would ask your service for a time, in exchange for the favor of Lathander.~

@10601 =~Nightcloak of Shar~
@10602 =~NIGHTCLOAK OF SHAR: Shar is the goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness. Her main aspect is worshipped by those who deal in the night (such as thieves), who hate the light (such as goblin races and their allies), and who feel bitterness and loss. Her symbol is a black disk with a border of deep purple.

Shar's mortal enemy is the goddess Selûne and the two fight on a number of levels throughout their immortal lives. There is a continual war between the two faiths and jihads against Selûne and her followers are common where Shar is strong.

Clerics of Shar are called Nightcloaks. They exist outside the standard church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering of cells and secretive places throughout the Realms. The Nightcloaks of Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.

Nightcloaks of Shar can only be of Neutral Evil, Lawful Evil, Chaotic Evil, and True Neutral alignments.

Abilities:
- Spiritual Weapon: Chakram - 'Disc of Night' once per day
The Disc of Night is the spiritual weapon of Nightcloaks. The chakram is treated as a returning dart and is wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The chakram is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.
- Immune to all forms of Blindness.
- Can cast Dark Bolt once per day.
This spell creates small chakrams in the casters hand (one per level of the caster). These chakrams can be hurled, causing silence on a failed save vs. spell on the target creature and causing 2d4 cold damage. Undead creatures must also make a save vs. paralyzation or be held for one round.
- From level 7 can cast Confusion once per day, as fourth level mage spell of the same name
- From level 9 can cast Feeblemind once per day, as fifth level mage spell of the same name
- From level 11 can cast Invisible Stalker once per day, as sixth level mage spell of the same name

Level: Quest

Area of Effect: Target, and anyone within 5 feet
Saving Throw: Neg

A powerful spell granted by Shar to the most worthy of her clerics, Shar's Curse sucks the wits from her foes, leaving them incapable of performing actions--a fitting curse from the Lady of Loss. Affected foes remain in this state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon them. The victim must make a save vs. spell at -4 in order to avoid the effect.

Choosing this ability permits the spell to be cast as an innate once per day. This may only be chosen once.~
@10608 =~Chakram - 'Disc of Night'~
@10609 =~The favored weapon of Shar is the Disc of Night, a chakram. Much like a dart, this circular metal weapon is thrown, and in this case will magically return to its owner.

Shar has gifted the most devout of her clergy, the Nightcloaks, with the ability to summon such a weapon, once a day. The weapon becomes more powerful as the cleric grows with power and importance in Shar's eyes. The chakram is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above.~

@10702 =~HOLY STRATEGIST OF THE RED KNIGHT: Holy Strategist is the name by which a cleric of the Red Knight is known, and it is an apt title indeed. By devoting themselves to mastering military tactics and strategy, these militant clerics hone their minds and bodies into the deadliest weapons in Faerun. So impressive is their reputation that armies outnumbering their foes three to one have been known to surrender upon learning that a Holy Strategist leads the opposing force.

Collectively, the clerics of the Red Knight are referred to as the Red Fellowship. Many members serve as high-ranking commanders in armies throughout Faerun, often personally leading elite "special forces" units. Others who are not directly in the employ of the church serve as instructors at military academies or as quartermasters in charge of keeping the troops on the front line fed and supplied. When they are not in battle, Holy Strategists wear flowing robes of red accented with white.

Calling upon Tempus for endurance in adversity, the Battleguard becomes protected from most physical harm. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of greater than +5 enchantment. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. However the casting time is also very short making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.

@11201 =~Painbearer of Ilmater~
@11202 =~PAINBEARER OF ILMATER: Ilmater is the Crying God, the god of endurance, suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's symbol was a blood stained rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a blood red cord is used. The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large. Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises.

The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers, but in reality they offer a great deal along the "pure clerical" nature of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray, with gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).

Painbearers of Ilmater can only be of Lawful Good, Neutral Good, and Lawful Neutral alignments.

Abilities:
- Spiritual Weapon: Fist - 'Hand of Ilmater' once per day
The Hand of Ilmater is the spiritual weapon of Painbearers. The Hand of Ilmater does 1d6 base damage and is treated as if the caster is a grand master. The Hand of Ilmater is treated as a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 25 and above. The Hand of Ilmater lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.
- Can Lay On Hands once per day
- From level 7 can cast Neutralize Poison once per day, as fourth level cleric spell of the same name
- From level 9 can cast Ilmater's Endurance once per day

- From level 11 can cast Heal once per day, as sixth level cleric spell of the same name

@11211 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Ilmater, you were summoned before the Revered Mother of your order. In plain words fitting for a follower of the Crying God, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring an end to the suffering to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and relief to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple’s casual worshipers in the city.

@11503 =~Firewalker of Kossuth~
@11504 =~FIREWALKER OF KOSSUTH: Kossuth, Firelord, the Tyrant among Fire, is an Elemental Lord from the Elemental Plane of Fire. He is generally uncaring to his faithful, but continues to grant his priests their powers since their worship increases his power on his home plane. To maintain continued worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems, and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never an avatar.

Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords, the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful in Thay and the lands of the East.

Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of any alignment, but most are evil, reveling in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and oranges.

Calling upon his deity's blazing touch, the Firewalker channels some of Kossuth's searing energy through himself. Both sides of fire's majestic power - both it's destructiveness, and it's ability to purify - are in evidence. Firstly, this spell deals 15d6 fire damage (save vs. spells for half) to all foes within 30 feet of the caster. This does not affect party members. Secondly, the caster's body is purified by the holy flames, as per the effects of a Heal spell.

He appears either as a gaunt, naked man with a great scimitar or a black cloud with glowing green eyes.

Xvim was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep during the Time of Troubles, where he was held for ten years. He managed to free himself when Zhentil Keep fell during the Cyrinishad fiasco, where he also managed to steal the portfolios of Tyranny and Hatred away from Cyric. He is now the god of Fear, Hatred, Malice, and Tyranny. He is working toward fully taking the place of his father, Bane, which makes him a bitter enemy of Cyric. His following is strongest in the East, particularly in Thay, but his priesthood is rapidly spreading throughout the Realms. His priests favor black robes trimmed with dark green.

She has been romantically linked with many of the Faerunian powers in the myths of the Realms, though she has never shown any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona, or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time of Troubles.

Sune's speciality priests, known as Heartwarders of Sune, are aesthetes and hedonists who actively seek out pleasure and beauty in all things, and who nurture the creation of beautiful objects.  They are typically found in large cities in the company of the cultural elite.  Most are active patrons of the arts, and all play the role of matchmaker for persons in all levels of society.  Many are employed as artists, crafters, performers, or instructors, though a few travel the world to promote beauty and love.

@12411 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Sune, you were summoned before the leader of your order. In warm words fitting for a follower of Sune, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and spread the love of Lady Firehair to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the opportunity. It seemed to be a chance to bring love and kindle passion in the cold North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple’s casual worshipers in the city.

@12703 =~FEYWARDEN OF CORELLON: The leader of the elven pantheon, Corellon Larethian (CORE-ehlon Lah-RETH-ee-yen) is said to have given birth to the entire elven race, although sometimes Sehanine or Angharradh are given credit as well. Elven lore states that the Fair Folk sprang from drops of blood Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun, and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf mages, musicians, and poets.

Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.

@13004 =~STRIFELEADER OF CYRIC: Cyric (seer-ick) is a megalomaniacal deity with an immense following. One of the three greater powers of evil on Faerun, he is petty and self-centered, and enjoys misleading individuals of all inclinations so that they perform acts that ruin their lives or so that they make fatal mistakes. He drinks the tears of disillusioned dreamers and broken-hearted lovers. He is not above an alliance with another deity as long as he thinks he can betray the other divine power and come out ahead.

Cyric's church is pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supports cruel rulers and indulges in intrigue in such a way that the world won't be overrun by wars (and thus fall under the sway of Tempus). His church is often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing, but this conflict has decreased in recent years as Cyric has gained better control of himself and has consolidated the churches of the deities whose portfolios he took over.

Strifeleaders wear black and purple robes. Silver bands, the symbol of their enslavement to Cyric, are worn on their wrists. Strifeleaders of Cyric may be of Chaotic Neutral or any Evil alignment.

- May coat his weapon in poison once per day per 6 levels.  
Attacks made in the next round with that weapon will inject the poison into the target, dealing out 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the first 6 seconds).  A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total.
- From level 7 can cast Dread Blast once per day
Fires a ray of negative energy that deals 4d8 damage +1/level (max +20) and confuses target for 1 round (save vs. spell at -2 to negate confusion)

@20302 =~oozemaster~
@20303 =~Oozemaster~
@20304 =~OOZEMASTER DRUID: Seeping out of every crack and crevice in the dungeon is some foul, monochromatic substance that adventurers wish wasn't there. Just when they get around the yellow mold, green slime drips from the ceiling. Quite often, such abominations well up naturally, but occasionally they are placed by a more deliberate hand--that of the oozemaster.

The oozemaster is not a class for stable individuals. It involves relating one-on-one with things that relate to nothing at all. Unlike the kindred creatures of most druids, the oozemaster's charges have nothing to say. No one has yet developed a Speak with Ooze spell--or if someone has, the oozes haven't responded. Given that oozemasters exude everything but confidence, most of them have few sentient friends and even fewer guests. Thus, they tend to gibber and talk to themselves a lot.

There are, however, substantial rewards to pursuing the path of the oozemaster. As their powers develop they find themselves taking on many of the characteristics of their favored creatures, although they become increasingly alien of mindset and find it harder to relate to others. By this point, though, they tend not to see this as much of a disadvantage.

Advantages:
- May use a Paralytic Touch attack once per day per 5 levels.
This spell functions in the same manner to the second level mage spell Ghoul Touch
- From level 5, the oozemaster's alien metabolism makes them immune to poison
- From level 7, may shapeshift to the form of a mustard jelly. This ability is useable 3 times per day
- From level 9, oozemasters become immune to acid
- From level 11, the oozemaster's alien metabolism renders them immune to disease
- From level 15, oozemasters become immune to blindness, sleep, paralysis, stunning and critical hits as they become one with the ooze and lack a discernable internal anatomy

Disadvantages:
- Do not gain other standard druidic special abilities (such as shapeshifting into wolves or bears, or the elemental resistance gained at high levels)
- Suffers a -1 penalty to Charisma at levels 1, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15 as they become increasingly separated from a humanoid mindset and their features continue to distort~

Advantages:
- +1 THAC0 and damage with any missile weapon for every three levels of experience, slowing to every five levels once the bowslinger reaches 18th level
- Can achieve high mastery (four points) in bows
- May use the 'Called Shot' ability once a day per four levels (starting at 4th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, any shot made within the next 20 seconds gains +1 to both THAC0 and damage for every four levels of experience
- May use the 'Speed Shot' ability once a day per eight levels (starting at 8th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, he makes one extra attack per round for five rounds
- May cast 'Detect Invisibility' once a day per six levels (starting at 6th level)

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf and half-elf.
- Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
- -1 to damage with any melee weapon
- Can only become proficient (one point) in long swords, short swords and daggers

@40601 = ~feralan~
@40602 = ~Feralan~
@40603 = ~FERALAN: What happens to children who wander in the wilderness and are never recovered? Or worse, those who are abandoned there? Many succumb to the dangers of the wild, but a fortunate few are taken in by animals, raised as a part of a lion`s brood, or a wolf`s litter. Cut off from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted them, forming some kind of unity with the spirit of the wild. In the process they become feralans, beings who combine the savagery of beasts with the intellect of man.

Feralans cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +10% to stealth
- +1 to Armor Class for every 5 levels of experience (starting at 1st level)
- May use the 'Feral Rage' ability once a day per 10 levels.  The enraged state lasts for 60 seconds, and grants a bonus of +2 to hit, damage, and AC, and immunity to charm, hold and fear, maze, imprisonment, stun and sleep.  He also gains 15 temporary hit points
- May use the 'Call of the Wild' ability once a day.  This unique ability summons an animal companion who will fight for the caster for 3 rounds + 1 round/level.  More powerful creatures are summoned at higher levels.

Disadvantages:
- Becomes winded after Feral Rage. While he's winded he receives -2 to hit, -2 to damage and a +2 penalty to armor class
- Can only become proficient (one point) in bastard swords, long swords, short swords, two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, halberds, flails and crossbows
- Cannot wear any armor
- Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~

@40901 = ~forest runner~
@40902 = ~Forest Runner~
@40903 = ~FOREST RUNNER: Wherever a corrupt or oppressive regime holds power, there's bound to be a Forest Runner. Forest Runners rise in opposition to such regimes, living on the fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the law. They're criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and unjust rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Runner as a lawless troublemaker, commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best hope against a tyrannical government.

Forest Runners cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +5% to stealth
- Can achieve mastery (three points) with long bows, quarterstaffs, long swords, and daggers
- May use the 'Inspire' ability once a day per six levels (starting at 1st level).  This unique ability boosts the morale and attack rolls of the Forest Runner's companions for 3 rounds.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear any metallic armor
- Can only become proficient (one point) in axes, two-handed swords, warhammers, and crossbows~

@41201 = ~justifier~
@41202 = ~Justifier~
@41203 = ~JUSTIFIER: Some expeditions are so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.

For a determined Justifier no job is too difficult, no enemy too formidable. Their proficiency with weapons gives them an edge in combat, though the smaller time devoted to magical training leaves them slightly lacking in that department.

Justifiers must be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +10% to stealth
- +1 to hit and +1 to speed factor for every 10 levels of experience

Disadvantages:
- Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
- Spell casting ability limited to:
'Cure Light Wounds' and 'Armour of Faith' once each per day from level 8
'Luck' and 'Remove Fear' once each per day from level 10
'Draw Upon Holy Might' once per day from level 12~

@41501 = ~wilderness runner~

@41503 = ~WILDERNESS RUNNER: There are rangers, and then there are rangers.  Elves are uniquely connected with the rhythms of the forests, some more deeply than others.  Only those who have chosen to become rangers may elect to become more fully part of the forest, casting aside the trappings of even elven society to serve the needs of the wood.  They are called wilderness runners.

Advantages:
- +10% resistance to non-magical fire and cold
- Can achieve mastery (three points) in long bows and quarterstaffs
- May use the 'Enhanced Charm Animal' ability once a day per two levels (starting at 1st level). This unique ability replaces 'Charm Animal', lasting twice as long and affecting all animals in the vicinity
- Can set snares (starts at 20% and improves by 5% per level)

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
- May not wear any armor greater that studded leather
- Can only become proficient (one point) in flails, morningstars and warhammers
- Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~
